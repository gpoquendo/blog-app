# blog-app
A simple blogging platform with Node.JS.
A user (hardcoded for now which is 'admin') will need to login into the web app.
After logging in, user will be redirected to a home page.
The blog posts page is in a separated web page and will need to click a link to go there.
The blog posts page allows the user to create a new blog and see the posted blogs below the page.
To edit a blog, the user will be redirected to a separate page.
